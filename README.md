Building my first react tables using data from mongoDB. The columns can be sorted, when clicking on the headers.

## Test it on your computer
Clone the repository and install the nessecary npm modules from the package.json file:
```
npm i
```
After that the application and the express server can be run with:
```
npm run concurrent
```
This will open your browser at localhost:8080
Hope you enjoy ðŸ’š ðŸ’š ðŸ’š
